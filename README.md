# 🎾 Professional Tennis Data Science Journey
### From Machine Learning Fundamentals to Real-Time Engineering

## 🎯 The 2-Year Vision
I am on a mission to become an expert **Data Science Engineer** specializing in professional tennis analytics. This project documents my journey from mastering theoretical foundations with **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization** to building high-scale, real-time predictive models.

This repository serves as a live portfolio for **GrisaLogic**, demonstrating the technical depth and engineering rigor required for advanced sports analytics.

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Linear Regression & Cost Functions
In this initial phase, I applied **Linear Regression** to analyze the physical biomechanics of the sport, specifically the relationship between a player's height and their first-serve velocity.

### Key Concepts Mastered:
* **Model Representation**: Implementing $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$ to map features to targets.
* **Cost Function $J(w,b)$**: Utilizing the Squared Error Cost Function to mathematically measure prediction accuracy.
* **Advanced Visualization**: 
    * 2D Regression Line plotting.
    * 3D Interactive "Error Bowl" (Cost Surface) using Plotly to identify global minima.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
* **Environment**: Google Colab (GrisaLogic Workspace).
* **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Plotly.
* **Theory**: Andrew Ng / Stanford University.
